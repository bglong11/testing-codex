## 1. Actionable Verification Checklist

This checklist highlights potential inconsistencies and issues found in the ESIA data. Please review each item and make corrections in the source document.

*   **Verify Document Validity & Dates:** Confirm the actual submission, approval, and distribution dates of the ESIA report. The current dates (e.g., 17/01/2025, 8/02/2025) are in the future, indicating this factsheet may be based on a preliminary draft or contains placeholder information.
*   **Clarify Project Scope for LNG/Seaport:** Reconcile the explicit statement that the Preliminary ESIA "Does NOT cover LNG or Seaport" with subsequent discussions of their impacts ("greater effects from LNG/seaport," "conversion of lagoon segment into a harbor," "cumulative impacts... amplified by proposed LNG facility and seaport"). Determine if the ESIA's scope has changed, or if these elements are being discussed without full assessment.
*   **Resolve Construction Duration Contradiction:** Clarify whether the estimated construction duration is 6 years (Page 13) or 3 years (Page 28). This has significant implications for impact assessment and project planning.
*   **Reconcile Aubeon Village Distance:** Confirm the accurate distance of Aubeon Village from the refinery (1 km on Page 12 vs. 1.5 km on Pages 21, 28).
*   **Clarify Flare Location and Distances:** Investigate the inconsistency between the refinery's stated distance from Aubeon (1-1.5 km) and the flare's stated distance from Aubeon (~3 km). Confirm if the flare is located separately from the main refinery complex or if the distances are measured differently.
*   **Detail Hazardous Waste Management:** Request more specific estimates for the types and quantities of hazardous waste generated ("small, undefined quantities," "a few tonnes per year" is insufficient for a project of this scale). Verify the proposed management plans for these wastes.
*   **Assess Environmental Risk Characterization:** Review the conclusion that the refinery's impact on Aubeon Mangrove Lagoon is "significant yet manageable," in light of the entire project area being a "likely critical habitat area" and containing "extensive mangrove forests" and "Aubeon Lagoon indicated as Critical Habitat." Ensure the manageability claim is robustly supported.
*   **Address Stakeholder Engagement Gaps:** Request a detailed plan for how the acknowledged "infrequent and limited consultations" and "significant gap in community's understanding of environmental impacts" will be addressed in future engagement, prioritizing genuine local resident input.
*   **Specify Rainfall Data:** Clarify the "Natarbora average" rainfall from a range (740-900 mm) to a more precise average value for baseline environmental modeling.
